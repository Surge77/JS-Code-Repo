# Events 

In JavaScript, events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, often initiated by the user (like clicking a button) or by the browser itself (like page load). Events are a critical part of the Document Object Model (DOM) and allow developers to execute code in response to these actions, making web applications dynamic and interactive.
